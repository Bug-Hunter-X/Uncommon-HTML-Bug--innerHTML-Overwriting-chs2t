# Uncommon HTML Bug: innerHTML Overwriting
This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the use of innerHTML in JavaScript within an HTML context.
The bug arises from a misunderstanding of how innerHTML functions.  When innerHTML is assigned a new value, it completely replaces the existing content of the element, rather than appending to it.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and lost content.
The solution involves using alternative methods for updating HTML content that properly handle appending or inserting elements.
